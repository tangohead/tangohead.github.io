## Flyte - Under The Skin

I love everything Flyte do, and this is no exception. Different sound to their last couple of singles and I can't wait for the new album.

## Hayley Williams - FLOWERS for VASES / descansos

Another surprise album! I really enjoyed Petals for Armor last year, so was keen to listen to this. I really enjoyed it - great music, great lyrics, really nice sound. Super impressive that she recorded all the parts herself.

## Arlo Parks - Collapsed In Sunbeams

Arlo Park's singles have been super popular for good reason, and I think this might have been one of the most anticipated albums from this year. I liked it overall though I felt the first half was stronger than the second. Lots of hard hitting lyrics, especially in the first half.

## Kid Kapichi - This Time Next Year

Really good impression on the first listen. Decently heavy but interesting. I need to give it another pass this week though!
