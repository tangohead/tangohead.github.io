# Music This Week, 14th Feb 2021

A few more albums this week! 

## OK Human - Weezer

I picked this up from a needledrop review and was pretty impressed. Really interesting sounds and plenty good songs. Big fan of a 30 minute album too.

## For the first time - Black Country, New Road

Everyone is going mad for this. I can sort of see why but I think I need to listen another time or two.

## First Take - Roberta Flack

Just ace. Feels like digging out an old vinyl and finding gold.

## No Driver - I Love Your Lifestyle 

Getting lots of Brand New vibes from this album. I enjoyed the first half a lot, sort of got distracted in the second. I really enjoy seeing new albums with this kind of emo sound.

## Weird Years (Season 1) - Fickle Friends

Even more great stuff from Fickle Friends. Can't wait to catch them on tour when tours are a thing again.
