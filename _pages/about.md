title: About
---

I'm Matt Smith and currently I am a Postdoc at the University of Oxford. I work as part of the System Security Lab in the Department of Computer Science, under Prof. Ivan Martinovic, and research security in (mostly wireless) avionic systems. If you'd like to read more about that, my departmental page can be found [here](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/matthew.smith/).

Outside of that, I like all things bikes, music and data.
